# 42 Lisboa: The Piscine ðŸ’ª	

### The Piscine is an intensive 4 week bootcamp in which you learn a lot about coding, teamwork, and about 42. It is the most challenging phase of the process. 200 candidates started the September 2022 piscine and only around 80 made it up until the end! [#42 Lisboa](https://www.42lisboa.com/en/)

### **Piscine tips**


* After finishing shell00, focus on advancing C projects. All exams evaluate your C knowledge. Finish shell01 later in the course.

* Validate first C05 before C06, since for the second exam you'll need <strong>argc & argv</strong>.

* Test your C code exercises before submitting with fake moulinnete (main.c):
